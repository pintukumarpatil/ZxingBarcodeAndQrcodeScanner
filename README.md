# ZXing Android Embedded

Barcode scanning library for Android, using [ZXing][2] for decoding.

The project is loosely based on the [ZXing Android Barcode and Qr code Scanner application][2], but is not affiliated with the official ZXing project.

Features:

1. Can be used via Intents (little code required).
2. Can be embedded in an Activity, for advanced customization of UI and logic.
3. Scanning can be performed in landscape or portrait mode.
4. Camera is managed in a background thread, for fast startup time.
